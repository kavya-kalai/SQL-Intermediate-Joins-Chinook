Task 4: SQL Intermediate - Joins & Business Analysis

Internship: Data Analyst Internship (MSME) 


📌 Project Overview
This task focused on utilizing Intermediate SQL Joins to combine data across multiple tables within the Chinook Database. The goal was to solve complex business questions by mapping relationships between customers, orders, and products.




🛠️ SQL Techniques Applied

INNER JOIN: Combined Orders with Customer details to validate transaction counts and revenue.


LEFT JOIN: Identified "Inactive" customers who have registered but never placed an order for marketing targeting.


Multi-Table Joins: Linked Orders, Products, and Categories to calculate revenue distribution by product category.


Table Aliasing: Used clear aliases (e.g., c, o, p) to ensure query readability and professional standards.

📂 Deliverables

joins_queries.sql: Script containing all JOIN queries with technical documentation.


joined_output.csv: Exported results showing category-wise revenue distribution.


insights.txt: Three key business insights derived from the joined data outputs.

🧠 Technical Learnings
Mastered the distinction between INNER JOIN (matching records) and LEFT JOIN (including non-matching records for gap analysis).


Leveraged Foreign Keys to navigate relational data structures and ensure data integrity during analysis.



Final Outcome: Demonstrated ability to combine disparate data sources to generate comprehensive business reports.
